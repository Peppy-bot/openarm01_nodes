//! The bimanual coordination loop. Every tick it advances both arms' planners
//! and both grippers to candidate setpoints, governs the whole step
//! against the self-collision model in one call (arms and grippers are one
//! governed configuration), and publishes the governed per-arm setpoints and
//! per-gripper gripper fractions. One loop owns the governor (the single collision
//! model), both planners, and the backbone-executed gripper moves, so everything is
//! always governed together against a consistent configuration, and the
//! governed result is fed back so the next tick chases from where each DOF was
//! actually allowed to go.
//!
//! An arm whose follower has stopped delivering state is frozen at its held
//! setpoint and its wire goes silent, and the first delivery after the gap
//! re-anchors that setpoint on the measured pose, so a follower that restarts
//! is never handed a target that drifted while nobody could see the arm.
